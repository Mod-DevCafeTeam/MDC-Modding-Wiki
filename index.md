# Welcome to the MDC Modding Wiki!

This is an open-source wiki managed by members of the Mod Dev Cafe (MDC) and was created by modders, for modders.
You can join our [Discord server here](https://discord.gg/T5MGNBB)!

We don't like how there's many different tutorials all over the internet and each have different code styles and methods
of creating mods - especially those ones which still use outdated methods! Therefore this wiki has been created with
both those who create and consume tutorials in mind, providing a single place where many different tutorials can be
found, and anyone can contribute to them.

If you find any issues or would like to suggest any change/improvements to this wiki, then please check existing issues
or create a new one over at the [issues page](https://github.com/Mod-DevCafeTeam/MDC-Modding-Wiki/issues).

If you'd like to contribute to this wiki, then please head over to the
[contributing page](./CONTRIBUTING).
