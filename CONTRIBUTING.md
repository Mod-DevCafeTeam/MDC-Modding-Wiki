# Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this wiki, then you can create pull requests to
[this repository](https://github.com/Mod-DevCafeTeam/MDC-Modding-Wiki) for changes or additional content. However,
there's a few rules you must abide by to keep this wiki well structured, clean and consistent:

* Please create tutorials in the most suitable categories. If a category does not exist, then you may create a new one
and it will be reviewed in your pull request.
* Tutorial page file names should always be in lowercase for consistency (e.g. `new_project.md`)
* Always add your new tutorial to the relevant index page, e.g. 
[index_1_12.md](https://github.com/Mod-DevCafeTeam/MDC-Modding-Wiki/blob/master/pages/1_12/index_1_12.md).
* When creating classes, please use the default code style and make code clean and readable.

Please try to also consider the following:

* Create example classes/resources where necessary. If you include any extra files with your tutorial, then you can
group everything into a single directory.
* Tutorials' code examples should be written in Java first. Other language examples (e.g. Kotlin, Scala) can then be
included.
